# System Overview

Assembly by Tenra is a human-in-the-loop system for turning repo evidence, editorial context, and internal notes into reviewable content outputs.

## Current product shape

- `apps/webapp` is the fuller cloud-backed implementation today
- `apps/desktopapp` is a local desktop workbench for manual content items, review gates, approvals, and Markdown export
- `packages/*` hold the low-risk shared logic both targets can reuse now

## Operating pipeline

1. Connect repos with the read-only GitHub App and select the allowlist
2. Capture evidence from repos or paste internal notes
3. Create briefs from evidence or direct prompts
4. Draft posts or Content Ops artifacts
5. Apply human review and approval gates
6. Propose schedules and track manual tasks
7. Record state transitions in audit logs

## Core boundaries

- GitHub access is read-only
- AI proposes; humans approve
- No auto-posting or silent publishing
- The webapp remains the authoritative cloud-backed path for auth, repo sync, API workflows, and Prisma-backed state
- The desktop app owns local manual drafts and approval/export workflows until durable local storage and sync are expanded

## Key UI routes

- Dashboard: `/dashboard`
- Content: `/content`
- Briefs: `/briefs`
- Inbox: `/inbox`
- Schedules: `/schedules`, `/schedules/manage`
- Tasks: `/tasks`, `/tasks/manage`
- Settings: `/settings`, `/settings/integrations/github`

## Key code anchors

- Shared types: `packages/shared-types`
- Shared validation/parsing: `packages/domain`
- Shared prompt composition: `packages/prompts`
- Web auth/session path: `apps/webapp/lib/auth`, `apps/webapp/proxy.ts`
- Web database path: `apps/webapp/prisma`, `apps/webapp/lib/prisma.ts`
- Web GitHub integration: `apps/webapp/lib/github`, `apps/webapp/app/api/github/*`
- Desktop workbench and Rust boundary: `apps/desktopapp/src`, `apps/desktopapp/src-tauri`
