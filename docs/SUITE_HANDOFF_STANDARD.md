# Suite Handoff Standard

Generated from `tenra Hub/contracts/handoff-catalog.json` by `tenra Hub/scripts/generate-suite-contract-docs.mjs`.

## App Role

document and content assembly module

keep unique; other apps may call Assembly for draft creation, but every producer must still be useful without Assembly.

## Standalone Mode

Runs as a complete document and project-note workspace with local drafting, content records, project notes, and proxy-notice export.

- `draft`: Payload or route exists locally but has not been previewed.
- `previewed`: Payload was built and inspected without delivery.
- `queued`: Delivery is waiting for an endpoint, retry, or operator action.
- `sent`: Producer posted or exported the payload successfully.
- `accepted`: Consumer parsed and retained the payload.
- `rejected`: Consumer refused the payload for schema, routing, safety, or policy reasons.
- `failed`: Delivery failed before acceptance or rejection was known.
- `replayed`: Registry or a producer regenerated a prior payload for another delivery attempt.
- `received`: Consumer acknowledged receipt back to the source app.
- `dismissed`: Operator intentionally removed an item from an inbox, queue, or retry list.
